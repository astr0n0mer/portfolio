          <p>
            Building software is not like constructing a building where you
            build it and just forget about it. A software has to keep up with
            new feature requests, bug fixes, latest trends, etc. I won&#39;t be
            wrong when I say building and maintaining a software involves a ton
            of blood, sweat (but mostly tears).

              If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs,

              civilization.

                  Well written code helps the team have confidence when making a
                  change to the codebase that this change will not break the
                  system.

                  Testing is essentially automatically validating if the
                  software produced fulfils the business requirements or not.

                  As a software grows, it gets worked on by a lot of people.
                  Writing test ensures that every change is approved by the
                  requirements and non-compliant code is blocked right at the
                  source.
                </li>

              Detect failures before they even happen
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Testing helps detect issues even before they reach the end
                  user. This helps improve the quality assurance from the team
                  as bad code is not shipped in the first place.

            This is why testing your code is more important than ever, and TDD
            (Test-driven Development) helps us achieve precisely that. TDD is
            key practice of

              >Extreme Programming</a
            >
            that enables software engineers to have some degree of confidence
            that their code will work as expected in production.

            As stated by
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin"
              target="_blank"
              >Robert &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; Martin</a
            >, TDD uses the Red ⇨ Green ⇨ Refactor cycle to write code. The goal
            is to keep the code changes as short as possible by writing the
            minimum amount of code while maintaining the existing functionality.
          </p>
          <p>Let&#39;s see the actions involved in each step:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Red</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Write a failing test.</li>
                <li>No production code should be written before this step.</li>
                <li>
                  Ideally, you should have only one failing test at a time.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Green</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Write just enough code to pass the test.</li>
                <li>Future scenarios should be avoided in this step.</li>
                <li>
                  Prematurely optimizing your code here would introduce
                  unnecessary complexity and might diverge your intent.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refactor</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Criticize and refactor the code.</li>
                <li>
                  Refactoring the code should not have any effect to the test
                  result.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As no one is good enough to write the working code and the
                  most optimum code in the first go, optimizations should be
                  reserved for this step.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="benefits-of-tdd">Benefits of TDD</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Clarity of intent
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As you write the purpose of the production code first, in the
                  test in the form of a failing test, you have a clear intent of
                  how the code should behave.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              No unused code
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As the Red ⇨ Green ⇨ Refactor cycle requires you to write only
                  as much code as necessary to pass a test, you avoid writing
                  code for scenarios that might never happen.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Less debugging
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since ideally, all the scenarios will be tested while testing
                  and development, there is little to no effort spent on
                  debugging
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Easier to maintain
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As all the components are tested in an isolated environment, a
                  component&#39;s inner working can be changed completely while
                  keeping the input and output same.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Saves cost in the long run
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As TDD makes us write tests before writing any production
                  code, these tests stand guard against breaking changes,
                  thereby reducing possibility of bugs and enabling timely
                  delivery of software.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Immediate feedback loop
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since you write the tests first, any code that does not
                  contribute in fulfilling the business requirement is discarded
                  at source. This helps you keep check of useful and useless
                  code.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Tests document the code
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Though documentation itself is a very important aspect of
                  software engineering, tests could be a very good starting
                  point stating how the software is expected to be used.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So, with the knowledge of TDD (Test-driven Development), will you
            choose the blue pill and go back to continue making buggy software
            or will you choose the red pill and start creating better tested,
            extensible and maintainable software.
