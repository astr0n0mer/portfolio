            Aren't those two synonyms. No, they're not. A Software Engineer is
            the superset of a Programmer. Let's dive deep into how exactly they
            differ.
          </p>
          <h2 id="what-s-the-difference">What's the difference</h2>

          <p>
            Well, a programmer is generally someone who's good at creating stuff
            through the means of code. When they get a specification to create
            something, they start writing code with a certain use case in mind.
            This is not much of a problem when you are working in smaller teams
            or building projects of your own. However, the moment you start
            working on projects where a good number of teammates are involved,
            you'll quickly find yourself under a big pile of code because to
            change one thing, 5 other things need to be modified.
          </p>

          <p>
            A software engineer on the other hand, will question themself at
            each step of the process, ensuring that anything they change will be
            understood unambiguously by the next person who happens to encounter
            this change.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are no steps set in stone that one could follow to transition
            from a programmer to software engineer, but one can inculcate the
            following qualities/habits that are often found in good software
            engineers
          </p>

          <h2 id="think-solutions-not-code">Think solutions, not code</h2>
          <img

            alt=""
          />

          <p>
            The most recurring mistake programmers do is immediately think in
            terms of code when presented with a problem. This approach does not
            scale well because there are a lot of black boxes at the early
            stages of any project. These black boxes might introduce features
            that could render your approach unusable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hence, it is crucial to think in terms of entities, their
            responsibilities and the flow of information between these entities.
          </p>

          <h2 id="start-small">Start small</h2>

          <p>
            To think solutions, start by approaching the most basic version of
            your problem. This will enable you to eliminate majority of the
            known and unknown variables alike from your solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tackling your problem in isolation allows you to focus on the core
            components of the problem. Create a solution for this version then
            incrementally keep on increasing the set of requirements and rinse
            &amp; repeat.
          </p>

          <h2 id="docs-come-before-code">Docs come before code</h2>

          <p>
            The importance of documenting a solution before attempting it is
            arguably the most important step in developing a project. Practices
            like dry running approaches and writing pseudocode are worth the
            overhead that they bring to the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            As any programming language has its own set of rules and
            limitations, changing documentation is so much easier than changing
            code.
          </p>

          <p>
            So next time, before you jump straight to coding a solution, try
            writing the approach first and you might find issues early on that
            might have stayed hidden for weeks.
          </p>

            technique.
          </p>

          <h2 id="set-goals">Set goals</h2>
          <img

          />

          <p>
            No, I'm not talking about setting up long term goals like a
            motivational speaker. Setting up goals in the short term means to
            just write your intent.
          </p>

          <p>
            People don't realize that just writing down the next 3 steps that
            you want to take resolves so much of the indecisiveness and
            introduces a ton of clarity to an approach.
          </p>

          <p>
            It does not matter if the approach you tried out failed. You just
            checkout off one method that you thought would've worked from the
            "approaches" list. Be willing to start with a clean slate and better
            understanding in case things go sideways.
          </p>

          <h2 id="be-your-first-reviewer">Be your first reviewer</h2>
          <img
            src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ANbD1CCdA3iI8/giphy.gif"
            alt=""
          />

          <p>
            Always be critical of your solutions. Just because you wrote it,
            does not mean you should assume it would work in a certain way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of cases where it could fail and be open to corrections from
            others. It is better if you spot your mistakes before anyone else.
            After all, who doesn't want to ship bugless products.
          </p>

          <h2 id="choose-your-trade-offs">Choose your trade-offs</h2>

          <p>
            All decisions in software engineering and by extension in life come
            with benefits and trade-offs. You have to choose which trade-offs
            are you okay living with.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, if you choose a particular technology to work with, be prepared
            to work around its limitations. If you choose an approach to solve a
            problem, get ready to meet some unexpected guests down the
            implementation road.
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, that's all I have for you today. Implement these habits in
            your problem solving process and I'll see you later.
          </p>
